1. Please note that it's a fixed width pure CSS static version of the template.

2. No JavaScript or any other jquery plugins were not used, please let me know if you are looking for a slideshow feature as well so that I can integrate jQuery Cycle into it.

3. Browser compatibility results as tested on Windows 7

IE 8 - works well
Latest versions of Firefox and Chrome - works well
I certainly believe this would work on other browser versions as well since almost all the css properties and markup used is well supported in recent versions of almost all the browsers.

If you have any clarifications please don't hesitate to contact me at nivincp@gmail.com
